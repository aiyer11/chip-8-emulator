# chip-8-emulator
I developed a CHIP-8 emulator in Java as an introductory project in emulator development. This project provided me with a foundational understanding of the CHIP-8 architecture and offered a refresher on bitwise operations and register manipulationâ€”concepts I hadn't engaged with since graduating college. Throughout the development process, I learned how to render pixels on a screen and manage key inputs to move sprites and execute actions. Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience in emulator development, and I am eager to apply these skills to future projects.
